define('EMAIL_TEXT', 'Welcome to Mail Order Pet Supplies.  My name is Dan Cole and for over 40 years now I have enjoyed the beauty and relaxation from having aquariums in my home and or office.  Aside from enjoying the hobby and learning lots about keeping fish, plants, corals etc, I also learned that there was a need for affordable aquarium supplies.<br><br>Seeing that need I created Mail Order Pet Supplies.  That was over twenty years ago now, and since then we have delivered thousands of brand name products to satisfied customers from coast to coast.  They have saved money and enjoyed the convenience of home delivery.  Here is what a few of those customers had to say.<ul>
